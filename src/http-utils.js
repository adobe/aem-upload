 *
 * @param {object} requestOptions Will be passed as-is to the underlying HTTP request processor, axios.
 * @param {object} retryOptions Determines the behavior of the retry functionality.
 * @param {number} [retryOptions.retryCount] Specifies how many times, in total, the request will be submitted before giving up.
 * @param {number} [retryOptions.retryDelay] Specifies the amount of time to wait before retrying. The actual wait time will
 *   exponentially increase by this value for each retry.
 * @param {function} [retryOptions.onRetryError] Will be invoked with a single error before each retry. If all retries fail, the
 *   method will resolved with the last error instead. If this function throws an exception then the retry functionality
 *   will immediately be resolved with the thrown exception.
 * @param {Object} [cancelToken] If specified, can be used to cancel the request.
 * @returns {object} The response to the request, which will match the signature of an axios response. In addition
 *  to typical axios response data, the object will also have an "elapsedTime" property containing the amount
 *  of time (in milliseconds) it took for the request to complete.
